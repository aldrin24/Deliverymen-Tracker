# Deliverymen-Tracker
Android application to track location of a person through his unique id generated when he logs into the application. Though this is a generic
application, it can be used for the following application:

We all get messages that out parcel is out for delivery and going to be delivered on the day itself. We might not know when exactly will our 
parcel be delivered on that day. This application solves this problem by below approach:
1. When delivery associate logs into 'Deliverymen-Tracker', he gets a UNIQUE ID for that session which he sends to all the customers who are
   getting parcel that day.
2. Customers can open the application and can locate delivery associate's position by searching with unique id.
